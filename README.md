# Analysis of LIID Project for IDPs
The LIID project aims to empower IDPs in Nigeria, to better access existing humanitarian services and sustainably integrate into host communities by strengthening the psychosocial well-being, coping abilities, and integration skills of IDPs affected by trauma and displacement. The specific objectives are to:
- Co-design and implement a culturally adapted LSE intervention curriculum with IDP communities and local stakeholders in Nigeria
- Evaluate the effectiveness of a culturally adapted LSE intervention in improving mental health and psychosocial outcomes among IDPs
- Compare the implementation outcomes of in-person vs. Mobile (WhatsApp) facilitated delivery models for the LSE intervention
